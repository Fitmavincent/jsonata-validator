# Cursor Jumping Fix Demonstration

## The Problem (Before Fix)
When editing JSONata expressions in the playground, if there was a syntax error, the cursor would automatically jump to the error location and select the error text every time the validation ran. This made it very difficult for users to continue typing and fixing their expressions because the cursor kept getting moved away from where they were working.

## The Solution (After Fix)
We modified the `PlaygroundWebviewManager.ts` file to remove the cursor manipulation behavior while preserving the error highlighting functionality.

### Changes Made:
1. **Removed cursor jumping**: Eliminated `editor.selection = new vscode.Selection(range.start, range.end)`
2. **Removed forced scrolling**: Eliminated `editor.revealRange(range, vscode.TextEditorRevealType.InCenterIfOutsideViewport)`
3. **Preserved error highlighting**: Kept the diagnostic system that shows red squiggly underlines

### What Users Now Experience:
- ✅ **Error highlights**: Red squiggly underlines still appear at error locations
- ✅ **Cursor stays put**: The cursor remains where the user placed it
- ✅ **Hover information**: Users can still hover over errors to see details
- ✅ **Problems panel**: Errors still appear in VS Code's Problems panel
- ❌ **No more interruption**: Cursor doesn't jump away while typing

## Test Example:
Try editing this JSONata expression with an intentional error:
```jsonata
users[department = "Engineering"(.name
```

**Before fix**: Cursor would jump to the "(" character and select it
**After fix**: Cursor stays where you're typing, but you still see the red squiggly underline
